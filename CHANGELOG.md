# Changelog

Changes that a user of the tool would notice. Written for people who run
`tfg`, not for people who read its source. Internal work is recorded
separately in `CHANGELOG-DEV.md`.

A major version bump is also a statement about file hashes. Anything that
changes the bytes of a generated file is listed here as a breaking change,
because it turns other people's test suites red.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `tfg generate` produces text files of an exact size. Ask for 10 485 761
  bytes and you get exactly that, from 0 bytes upward.
- `tfg formats` lists what this build supports, with the fidelity level, the
  determinism level, the minimum size and the padding channel of each format.
- Every run writes a `manifest.json` next to the files - path, size, SHA-256,
  format, seed, tool version and the declared expectation for each file.
- `--dry-run` counts and shows without writing a single byte.
- `--seed` makes a run repeatable. The same seed gives the same bytes.
- `--clean` turns off the self describing label.
- `--json` writes the manifest to standard output, so it can be piped.
- `--expected` records what the system under test should do with the files:
  accept, reject, sanitize or unspecified.

### Safety

- **Nothing is written over.** A run that would land on a file already there
  stops and says which one, before writing anything. This tool runs in
  directories that belong to you.
- **Two files cannot head for one name.** A name template with no index and a
  count above one is refused while planning, rather than leaving one file on
  disk and a manifest describing three.
- **A run larger than the free space is refused before the first byte.**
  Finding out at file five thousand of ten thousand leaves a half written set
  and a full disk.
- **Ctrl+C is handled.** An interrupted run finishes or removes the file it
  was writing, keeps everything already completed, and still writes the
  manifest - so nothing incomplete is ever left in the output directory and
  cleanup has something to work with.

### Notes on behaviour

- **Sizes count in 1024s.** `10mb` is 10 485 760 bytes, which is what
  Windows Explorer and `ls -lh` both call "10 MB". `mib`, `kib` and `gib` are
  spelled out versions of the same thing. This departs from the SI standard
  on purpose - a file you asked for as 10mb has to look like 10 MB when you
  check it. Write the number if you want exactly ten million bytes. A size
  that does not land on a whole byte is an error rather than a rounded
  number.
- **`--size` is required.** Every target declares its size, which is what
  lets `--dry-run` report exact numbers before anything reaches the disk.
- **The label needs room.** A text file smaller than the label carries no
  label. The run says so and the manifest records it, so a missing label is
  never a silent difference from what you ordered.
- **The last word can be clipped.** Hitting the exact size wins over ending
  on a word boundary.
- Text files are UTF-8 with LF line endings. Other encodings and line endings
  are not implemented yet.
