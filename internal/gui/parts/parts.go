// Package parts holds the pieces every window is built from.
//
// It exists because of what this interface is going to become rather than what
// it is today: many windows, many fields, many buttons, the same shapes over
// and over. A window that builds its own labelled entry is a window that will
// word its own error, size its own gap and validate its own value - and the
// third of those breaks G1 in the way nobody sees, because a form with its own
// rule is a second copy of rules the engine already owns.
//
// Two properties hold this package together.
//
// It knows nothing about windows. Nothing here opens, closes or navigates, so
// a part can be rendered on its own - which is what lets the golden images sit
// on parts rather than on whole screens. An image of a whole window changes
// with every layout change and stops being read after the third time. An image
// of one field in four states is stable and says something.
//
// It never reaches the toolkit's app package. Everything here builds a widget
// tree and nothing drives one, so this package compiles and tests with
// CGO_ENABLED=0, on a runner with no graphics and no C compiler.
