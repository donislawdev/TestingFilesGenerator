// About is what the licence screen says.
//
// It carries the sentence somebody deciding whether to put this tool into a
// closed source product cannot get anywhere else: the licence covers the tool
// and not the files it makes. "tfg license" has printed it since 2026-08-04 and
// somebody using only the window had no way to read it, which is the drift D1
// exists to stop - in the one place the parity guard cannot see, because a
// licence is not a capability of the engine. docs/GUI.md section 7 names it.
//
// It was the opening screen while the window had only one. It is a screen you
// go to now rather than one you are shown, because a notice shown at every
// start is a notice nobody reads twice - and the window opens on the work.
//
// The text is not repeated here. It comes from version.LicenceNotice, the same
// constant the command prints, so the two cannot come to say different things.
// It carries no way back, and has not needed one since 2026-08-11: it is a tab,
// so every other screen is one click away and always visible. As a screen that
// replaced the whole window it needed a door, and a door somebody could delete
// without noticing was the thing worth guarding.
